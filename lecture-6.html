## Lecture 6: Extending Space to Prove Desargues's Theorem

</md>

<p>
As we've stated it, Desargues's Theorem concerns triangles in the two dimensional extended plane P².  However, there is also a more general version of Desargues's Theorem, which concerns triangles living in a three dimensional space.  Surprisingly, this 3D version is easier to prove than the 2D version!

<p>
Now that we've defined the extended Euclidean space P³, let's state the 3D version of Desargues's Theorem.

Let's return to the shadow drawing challenge from the introduction video for Chapter Two.  It will provide a key insight for proving Desargues's Theorem!

Let's see how the drawing challenge relates to Desargue's Theorem.

<p>
We've proved Desargues's Theorem for non-coplanar triangles in P³.  But what about triangles in P³ that lie on a common plane?

<p>
We still need to prove the converse to Desargue's Theorem: if two triangles are in perspective from a line, then they must be in perspective from a point.  We'll leave this proof as an exercise, but the following video provides some hints.
