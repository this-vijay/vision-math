# The Geometry of Vision





## Lecture 8: Projectivities and the Three-Fixed Points Theorem

</md>

<p>Perspectivities seem quite useful, but are they really the perspective-shifting maps we've been looking for?</p>

<p>Let's look at some examples of one dimensional projectivities -- that is, projectivities between (extended) lines in P³.</p>

<p>That example was rather simple.  Can imagine a slightly more complicated scenario?</p>

<p>Now let's make things more interesting, by imagining projectivites from the real line to itself.  We can then think of these projectivities as functions!</p>

      answer: `∞`,
      response: `No. You seem to be applying the perspectivities in the reverse order.  Remember, in composition notation, we apply the righthand function first, followed by the lefthand function.

<p>And now for something special...a little theorem that many important results will rest upon!</p>
