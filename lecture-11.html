# The Geometry of Vision





## Lecture 11: The Real Projective Plane

</md>

<p>The analytic approach relies on a powerful new model of our geometry of points and lines.  It is known as RP², the <i>real projective plane</i>.</p>

<p>We need a convenient notation for referring to the points of RP² -- in other words, a way to refer to lines through the origin in R³.</p>

<p>Let's apply homogeneous coordinates to give a simple proof of the Vanishing Point Theorem from Chapter One.</p>

<p>Homogeneous coordinates also give a neat way to compute the projective line determined by two projective points. And also the projective point determined by two projective lines.</p>
