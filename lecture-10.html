## Lecture 10: Examining the Cross Ratio

</md>

<p>Let's start by defining the cross ratio more precisely.</p>

</mcq>

<p>Are there any other sets of collinear points for which we might want to check the cross ratio?  How about four evenly spaced points?</p>

<p>In case you've encountered the cross ratio elsewhere, you might have seen it defined differently.   This is because there's actually several different formulations of the cross ratio, all equally valid!</p>

<p>Let's prove the invariance of the cross ratio -- and finally answer the question of what stays the same under a perspective shift!</p>

<p>In addition to its invariance under perspective shifts, the cross ratio displays another very important property.</p>

<p>Putting together the invariance and injectivity of the cross ratio, we can finally prove the Three Fixed Points Theorem, which has been at the heart of all our major results!</p>

    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `False`,
      response: `Correct!  The cross ratio (A,C;B,D) = -1/4.  By the Fundamental Theorem, you can map A, B, and C to any three evenly spaced points on the real number line, say 0, 1, and 2.  But then D cannot map to the point 3, since that would give a cross ratio of -1/3.   Therefore these points cannot possibly appear evenly spaced from any perspective view!`
    }

</mcq>

<p>As we saw while proving the injectivity theorem, it's often natural to fix three points and think of the cross ratio as a function on the fourth.  Let's finish our introduction to the cross ratio by taking a closer look at that function.</p>
