## Lecture 3: Using Vanishing Points to Draw in Perspective

</md>


<p>It's time for a quick tutorial on perspective drawing. </p>

<mcq label="Exercise 1" palette="past" :images="[`./images/box-3.PNG`]" question="If a box is oriented in two point perspective, how many edges of the box are parallel to the picture plane?" :choices="[
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `0`,
      response: `No...that would only be true if the box were oriented in three point perspective.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `2`,
      response: `Incorrect.  Notice, the edges of the box come in parallel groups of four.`
    },
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `4`,
      response: `Yes! The four vertical edges of the box will be parallel to the picture plane.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `8`,
      response: `No...that would only be true if the box were oriented in one point perspective.`
    }        
  ]">
</mcq>

<p>So vanishing points allow us to draw boxes in perspective...but let's see what this actually looks like in practice! </p>

<challenge label="Challenge 3" palette="past" image="./images/decorate.jpg" instruction="Decorate the landscape around your tracks, with boxes in one and two point perspective.  Get as creative as you like! Then, click here to upload a photo of your drawing to padlet."  padlet="https://padlet.com/vijayravikumar/5sgjvebkqq9s3fgy">
</challenge>

<p>Make sure to upload your perspective drawing to padlet, by clicking the link above.  
The drawing you've created represents a three dimensional scene, as it would appear to you if you were viewing it from a fixed position... But can the drawing tell us anything about that implied viewing position? </p>

      correct: false,
      answer: `False`,
