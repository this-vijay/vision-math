## Lecture 4: The Extended Euclidean Plane

</md>

<p>
In order to develop Projective Geometry, we'll need to make some careful definitions.  Let's start by taking a closer look at <i>incidence</i>.

    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `Any two non parallel lines are incident with a unique common point.`,
      response: `Actually, this statement is true.  Since the lines live in R² and are not parallel, they must intersect somewhere.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: ` Any two distinct points are incident with a unique common line.`,
      response: `Actually, this statement is true.  We can rephrase it as saying: Any two points in the plane determine a unique line!`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: ` Any two distinct parallel lines will have zero common points they are incident with.`,

    },
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: ` Any three distinct points will have zero common lines they are incident with.`,
      response: `Yes, this statement is indeed false.  The three points could be collinear, in which case they will have a common line they are incident with.`

common point.`,

      correct: false,
      answer: `Any three distinct points in R³ are incident with a
unique common plane.`,

<p>
There are certain basic axioms of incidence that a geometry of points and lines ougth to satisfy.  Let's take a look at these now.
