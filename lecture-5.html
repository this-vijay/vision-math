<p>
Are there any interesting results in this geometry of points and lines?

<p>
In order to construct the harmonic conjugate, we freely chose points P and Q.
Can we prove that the harmonic conjugate is truly independent of our choices?

Let's take a closer look at a second co-incidence, known as Pappus's Theorem!

<mcq label="Exercise 3" palette="past" :images="[`./images-chapter-2/chapter-two-pappus-case.jpg`]" question="What is the conclusion of Pappus's Theorem when just X lies at infinity, but Y and Z do not, as pictured here? " :choices="[
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `A, B, or C must lie at infinity in this case.`,
      response: `No. Look at the picture carefully.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `The line XY or and the line XZ must be parallel.`,
      response: `Hang on...Pappus's Theorem says X, Y, and Z must be collinear.  But what would that look like if X is at infinity?`
    },
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `The line YZ is parallel to both Ab and Ba.`,
      response: `Correct!  Since both Ab and Ba meet the point at infinity X, they must be parallel to each other.  And since X, Y, and Z are collinear, the line YZ will also be in that parallel family.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `This cannot happen.  One of the sets {A, B, C} or {a, b, c} must not be collinear.`,
      response: `In fact it can happen.  Look at the picture more carefully.`

And last but not least, let's examine Desargues's Theorem more closely!
