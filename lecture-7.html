# The Geometry of Vision





## Lecture 7: A Closer Look at Perspectivities

<p>Let's try defining perspectivities more precisely.</p>

<mcq label="Exercise 1" palette="past" :images="[`./images-chapter-3/chapter-3-rational-map.jpg`]" question="Consider non-parallel planes π and π' in R³, and a point O off of both planes.  Let S be the set of points x in π such that Ox does not intersect π'.  What is S?" :choices="[
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `S is the line of intersection of planes π and π'.`,
      response: `No. If x is in the intersection of planes π and π', then Ox will intersect π' at x itself!`
    },
    {

    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `S is the empty set.`,

    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `We need more information about the relative positions of π and π' to determine S.`,

    {

      response: `Actually, since the planes live in P³, there is a point at infinity that the line and plane will have in common. Can you see which one?`
    }

<p>We've defined perspectivities abstractly...but can we imagine some real life examples?</p>

<mcq-pictorial label="Exercise 3" palette="past" :images="[`./images-chapter-3/chapter-3-pinhole.jpg`]" question="What is the missing portion of the image of the railway tracks under the above perspectivity from plane π to plan π'. " :choices="[

      answer: `A`,

    },

      picture: `./images-chapter-3/chapter-3-pinholeC.jpg`, 
      response: `Not quite.  Remember, in this region, the perspectivity is orientation reversing.  How would that affect the location of the brown line?`
    },
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `D`,
      picture: `./images-chapter-3/chapter-3-pinholeD.jpg`, 
      response: `Yes!  The brown line will appear on the opposite side of the railway tracks, since in this region the perspectivity is orientation reversing.`
    }

</mcq-pictorial>

<p>Wait a second, does our definition fully make sense?  Are perspectivities well defined on all points of an extended plane, including its points at infinity?</p>

    },
    {

      answer: `False`,
      response: `Actually, they do intersect.  Remember, ℓ is in P³, not R³.`

      correct: true,
      answer: `the line at infinity associated to plane π'.`,

<p>Let's use this notion of a perspectivity to take care of some unfinished business.</p>
