## Lecture 12: Transformations of the Real Projective Plane

</md>

<p>Before we try to understand transformations of RP², we need a better way to visualize the points and lines in RP².</p>

<p>We've gotten quite familiar with projectivities, the transformations of the extended Euclidean plane. What would the analogous transformations of RP² look like?</p>

<p>The projective linear group PGL(3,R) consists of transformations of RP². Can we somehow characterize these transformations?</p>

    },
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `False`,

<p>Okay, so the projective linear group PGL(3,R) is really an analytic formulation of the set of projectivities.  Let's try visualizing the action of PGL(3,R) on the affine plane z=1, and in the process gain more clarity about the types of projectivities that exist.</p>

<p>The Fundamental Theorem of PGL(3,R) remains to be proven.  For this we'll need some linear algebra.</p>
