<mcq label="Exercise 7" palette="past" :images="[`./images/v1f-exercise.png`]" question="Here is a painting by Gustave Caillebotte, with the horizon line marked in yellow.  Notice that the red and blue families of parallel lines have vanishing points lying off of the horizon line.  Why does this not contradict the Horizon Line Theorem?" :choices="[
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `The red and blue lines are parallel to the picture plane.`,

    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `The red and blue lines do not represent families of parallel lines.`,
      response: `No. The red lines do indeed form one parallel family, and blue lines another.  This is why they converge to vanishing points, one above and one below the painting.`
    },

    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `The red and blue lines are not parallel to the ground plane.`,
      response: `Correct!  Both families have a vertical component, so they point upwards or downwards in space.  Since they aren't parallel to the ground plane, the Horizon Line Theorem does not apply.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `The yellow line is not the horizon line. The observer is viewing the scene with their head tilted 90 degrees, so the horizon line is vertical.`,
