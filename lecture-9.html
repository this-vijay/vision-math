## Lecture 9: The Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry

</md>


<p>Let's start by proving the the one dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry.  We call it <i>one dimensional</i> because it concerns projectivities between lines in in P³.</p>

<mcq label="Exercise 1" palette="past" :images="[`./images-chapter-3/chapter-3-two-examples.jpg`]"  question="Suppose F and G are two projectivities from line ℒ to line ℓ which both send point A to point a, point B to point b, and point C to point c.  Then F = G." :choices="[
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `True`,
      response: `Correct!  By the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry, F and G must agree everywhere, and hence be identical as functions from ℒ to ℓ.  The image above shows two different sequences of perspectivities that realize the projectivity F = G.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `False`,
      response: `Are you sure?  Recall the definintion of projectivity, as well as the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry.`
    }

<p>Next we'll prove Pappus's Theorem, for which we'll need a neat little construction.</p>

    {
      correct: false,

    },

      correct: true,
      answer: `False`,
      response: `Yes!  By the Fundamental Theorem, the three maps must be identical.`
    }

<p>We're now ready to prove Pappus's Theorem!</p>

    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `True`,
      response: `That's right! We needed the Three Fixed Points Theorem to know the two criss cross constructions yielded identical maps, and that the intermediate lines in both constructions were the same.  In fact it turned out to be the Pappus Line!`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `False`,
      response: `Actually we did require it, in a fundamental way!  There are alternate proofs of Pappus's Theorem that do not use it, but instead they use other machinery that we have not developed in this class.`
    }

<p>Finally, let's prove the two dimensional version of the Fundamental Theorem of Projective Geometry.  We call it <i>two dimensional</i> because it concerns projectivities between planes in P³. </p>

<mcq label="Exercise 5" palette="past" :images="[`./images-chapter-3/homework-3-ftpg.jpg`]"  question=" How can we be sure that the line R*R' meets the line  S*S' ?" :choices="[
    {
      correct: true,
      answer: `Because both the lines R*S* and R'S' contain A', and are hence coplanar.`,
      response: `Correct! It follows that R*R' and S*S' are coplanar, and hence intersect.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `Because the quadrilaterals P'Q'S*R* and P'Q'R'S' share an edge.`,
      response: `Actually that does not guarantee R*R' and S*S' will intersect.  There's something else at work.`
    },
    {
      correct: false,
      answer: `Because any two lines in P³ intersect.`,
      response: `Incorrect.  Lines in P³ intersect if and only if they are coplanar.`
    }
  ]">
</mcq>

<p>In order to complete the proof, we'll need a generalization of the Three Fixed Points Theorem...namely, the Four Fixed Points Lemma!</p>

      answer: `False`,

<p>Great, we've proved some interesting results about projectivities between planes.  But how does this relate to our original question, about the possible shadows of a square?</p>
